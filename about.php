        <p>My name is Magdalena Gołębiowska and I'm currently a second-year
        student at Wrocław University of Science and Technology, studying Quantum
        Engineering.</p>
        <p>I've always been passionate about visual design and as soon as I
        received tools to develop/design a website, I put them into practice. This later has
        led to gaining the experience both as a web developer/designer and
        a graphic designer while working for student associations,
           student conferences and in promoting the faculty I'm studying at (<a href="work.php">check my work</a>).</p>
